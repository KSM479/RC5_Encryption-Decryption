# Simple_Function

This is the working code for simple function of RC5 Encryption.. The first 2 lines have not been added.
You will not be able to implement the code on FPGA without the supporting constraint files. This code is also not compatible with the given UART Module.

YOU DO NOT HAVE TO RUN THE UART FOR THIS LAB.  

EDIT - The code is now compatible for running with UART.

HOW TO RUN ON UART

1)  INCLUDE ALL THE SOURCE FILES IN YOUR PROJECT
2)  INCLUDE THE SIMPLE FUNCTION OR THE INVERSE FUNCTION.VHD FILE
3)  MAKE SURE YOUR ENTITY NAME IS THE SAME AS Simple_One.
4)  GENERATE BITSTREAM AND DUMP IT ON YOUR FPGA
5)  OPEN YOUR SERIAL MONITOR
6)  SW[0] ON YOUR FPGA IS THE CLEAR AND SW[1] IS THE CLOCK SIGNAL 
7)  FOR THE CODE ON THE GITHUB. THE RC5 WILL RUN WHEN CLEAR IS 0. 
8)  TURN SW[0] TO 1. 
9)  IN YOUR SERIAL MONITOR PUT IN THE DIN. PRESS ENTER
10) TURN SW[0] (CLEAR) TO 0 AND TURN SW[1] FROM 0 TO 1 AND 1 TO 0. 
11) TURNING SW[1] FROM 0 TO 1 AND 1 TO 0 WILL GIVE A CLOCK SIGNAL. 
12) YOU WILL BE SEEING THE OUTPUT (DOUT) AFTER THE FIRST ROUND ON YOUR SCREEN.
13) DO THIS FOR ANOTHER 12 CLOCK CYCLES.
14) AFTER THE 13TH CLOCK CYCLE THE OUTPUT (DOUT) WILL BE SET TO ALL ZERO. 

Thank and regards,
